# user-role-authorization
This Laravel project focuses on user role authorization using role-based access control (RBAC) with MySQL. It includes features for user authentication, registration, and user management with different roles (admin and regular user). Admin users have access to admin-only routes, while regular users are restricted from accessing these routes.
